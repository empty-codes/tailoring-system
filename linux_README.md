This program stores customer records of any registered Fashion designer.
The fashion designer first creates an account and has a password and username which is stored in a text file to be used on subsequent logins.
Then the designer has the option of creating a new record or viewing already created ones.
The record of each customer is stored in a text file which is created on the data entry and is read from anytime, the record is needed to be viewed.
